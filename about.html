  <h1>ABOUT THE QUEEN</h1>
  <p>Raegan is a beautiful and bright young girl, who attends the University of
    Hartford and works a full time job trying to save her Community. The work that
    she does is very cruital to society.
    Raegan helps youth become positive productive persons of society, instead of letting the
     youth fall into being a product of their enviroment. My job pushes hard implement
   EQ learning. This is when a students emotional quotient is the main focus instead of
 IQ. (intelligence quotient) IQ focuses on mental functions, being taught math,
reading, social studies. etc. My work is based on how a student is feeling, thinking.
For example my student might not want to participate in class because they're to
busy trying to think of where their next meal is coming from.</p>
